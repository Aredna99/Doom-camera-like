This is an exercise done during my studying course in AIV, where I was trying to emulate the Doom's camera without using the Transform.LookAt function of unity.

This is also possible with the unity engine Transform.LookAt function. But I was trying to emulate his behavior by calculating the angle between the enemy and the camera using the Math.Atan2 function.
