# Doom-camera-like

This is a project developed during my course of study, in which I was trying to emulate the Dooms room without using unity's Transform.LookAt function, using the unity version 2020.1.6f1.

This is also possible with the unity engine Transform.LookAt function. But I was trying to emulate his behavior by calculating the angle between the enemy and the camera using the Math.Atan2 function.

Those image are not taken from my project, they are taken from the internet so do not expect anything special, just some math and code.
